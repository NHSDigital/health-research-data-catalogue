Record-level patient data set, where a record represents one death registration. The data are collected at source from Local Registry offices at the point of death registration. The data are collated nationally by the Register General before being passed to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), for use in statistics and coding. Coding includes such things cause of death coding using the International Classifications of Diseases (ICD) coding system, attributing socio-economic code classifications based on occupation. ONS maintains its own version of the data set for its use in statistics. The Civil Registration of Deaths data contains 14 million unique registrations since 1993 onwards, increasing yearly. Average 500,000 - 600,000 new death registrations yearly. Records cover all deaths registered in England & Wales. ICD coding is 9th and 10th. https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars.\n\nTimescales for dissemination can be found under 'Our Service Levels' at the following link: https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars/data-access-request-service-dars-process.",
