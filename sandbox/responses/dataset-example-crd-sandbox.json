Record-level patient data set, where a record represents one death registration. The data are collected at source from Local Registry offices at the point of death registration.

Average 500,000 - 600,000 new death registrations yearly. Records cover all deaths registered in England &amp; Wales.\nICD coding is 9th and 10th.\n\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars",
